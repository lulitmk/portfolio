            <p>Hello, I am Lullit Ketsela, a Computer Information Systems(CIS) Major at the University of Houston.
                This semester, I took Professor Crowley's Internet Application Development(CIS 2336)class.
                In this course I learned web development programming languages.<br>
                First I started out with HTML, then CSS, PHP, SQL, and lastly, JavaScript.
                Thus, the programming languages I learned in class has been beyond useful!
                This portfolio showcases my top assignments from the class. Navigate through the pages
                to see my journey through CIS 2336.
            </p>
